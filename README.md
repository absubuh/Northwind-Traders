About My Northwind Traders Project

My Northwind Traders Project is a comprehensive data analysis project that I completed, consisting of four main parts: SQL I, SQL II, Excel I, and Excel II. Each part focuses on different aspects of data analysis and presentation.

In SQL I, I queried the Northwind database to extract valuable insights, such as customer information, order details, and sales data, to gain a better understanding of the company's operations.

SQL II expanded on the SQL queries, diving deeper into customer analysis, product sales, and revenue trends to provide a more detailed overview of Northwind's business performance.

For Excel I, I delved into data visualization and analysis using Excel, presenting information on sales distribution across different countries, top-selling product categories, and customer spending patterns.

In Excel II, I concluded the project with advanced Excel analysis, including price and quantity optimization scenarios, profitability analysis for different product categories, and recommendations for maximizing total revenue.

Overall, my Northwind Traders Project showcases my proficiency in SQL querying, data analysis, and presentation skills using Excel. It provides valuable insights and recommendations for business decision-making based on the analysis of Northwind's data.
